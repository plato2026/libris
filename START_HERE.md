## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY NOTES

### ❌ NEVER COMMIT YOUR API KEY!

The `.gitignore` file prevents this, but be extra careful:

**WRONG ❌:**
```python
# In streamlit_app.py
api_key = "sk-ant-abc123..."  # NEVER DO THIS!
```

**RIGHT ✅:**
```python
# In streamlit_app.py
api_key = os.environ.get("ANTHROPIC_API_KEY")  # Good!
```

**RIGHT ✅:**
```toml
# In Streamlit Cloud secrets (NOT in GitHub!)
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY = "sk-ant-abc123..."  # Safe!
```

### If You Accidentally Commit a Key:
1. **Immediately** delete the key at console.anthropic.com
2. Generate a new key
3. Remove from Git history (see DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md)
4. Use the new key in Streamlit secrets
